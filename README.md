# nutil - Node Utility

A command-line tool for generating boilerplate (controllers, services, models and resources) based on placeholders provided by the user.

## Installation

Run:
* `yarn install` or `npm install`

You will then be able to run `nutil` from the command line. 

## Usage

Create a controller based on the [provided placeholder](https://github.com/fcouceiro/nutil/tree/master/placeholders/controllers):

    nutil --controller (-c) <controllerName>

  

Create a service based on [provided placeholder](https://github.com/fcouceiro/nutil/tree/master/placeholders/services):

    nutil --service (-s) <serviceName>

  

Create a model based on [provided placeholder](https://github.com/fcouceiro/nutil/tree/master/placeholders/models):

    nutil --model (-m) <modelName>

  

Create a resource based on [provided placeholder](https://github.com/fcouceiro/nutil/tree/master/placeholders/resources):

    nutil --resource (-r) <resourceName>

  
Multiple generations can take place with a single command, by concatenatig different options. Example: create both a controller and a service:

    nutil -s <serviceName> -c <controllerName>

## How it works
There is a pre-defined set of placeholder keys, as represented in the following table:

Key | Meaning
--- | ---
[name] | Singular lower case
[NAME] | Singular upper case
[Name] | Singular pascal case
[names] | Plural lower case
[NAMES] | Plural upper case
[Names] | Plural pascal case

When the user requests the generation of a certain type, the generator spawns a process that "search and replace" the corresponding type placeholders (both in file name and file content). It substitutes all found keys with the appropriate casing (e.g. [name] would be replaced by the controller name in singular lower case; [Names] in plural pascal case; etc).

Case representations are generated by the great [inflection package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inflection).

## Placeholders
All boilerplate is generated based on placeholders provided by the user. 
Feel free to use different placeholder keys in both file name and content, as described in [How it works](#how-it-works) section.

Placeholders must be placed inside `placeholders/` folder. 

A few basic placeholders are included by default (using mongoose).
